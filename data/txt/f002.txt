appears to me of sufficient weight to justify that man is [?]
for not entering in the business, precisely in the manner
proposed by Mr Gale, which you will recollect was to estimate
the value of the new stock on the depreciated value of the
[the] three per cents sh[ow]ing the mean value of the latter at
63 1/3, by which the public would share [nearly] or rather
recover nearly what they had lost by the enormous
premiums which have been given but such an estimate of the three per cents
might be considered as taking an undue advantage of the
creditors, who [ought] would expect [ought] to be paid the nominal capital which
they received for the money they lent, be the latter more or
less - Indeed if the conversion was made on the nominal
capital, the debt in the new stock would be greater, and consequently
the greater revenue must be [applied] provided for payments
of the interest, but still the power of the [lending?] fund
[would] [app????] [from] t the redemption. If [irredeemably?] applied
would be such, as in about 25 years to superceed the necessity
of any loans for the payment of the annual tender for
the redemption. - and thence forward (the revenue which at
the commencement of the conversion was sufficient for the
[first] years interest) would be an accumulating [something] [pounds]
which would always keep the debt within moderate bounds
nay at any point which prudence and the weal of the
nation should dictate, even altho wars and their
attendant expenses should prevail as often as they
have done in the present century -
