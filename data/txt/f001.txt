My Dear sir

[agreeably to your request I should have eludicated]
Mr Gales [algebraic demonstration] theorem relative to the value
of annuity stocks, the worth of which he has demonstrated by an algebraic [process]
process. I have confirmed by an [algeb] arithmetic computation
and which you will have inclosed.

Mr Gale in his second Essay page 72 and in his third Essay
page 60, posits that he has left [something] a particular unexplained relative
to the conversion of the debt, without [which] the knowledge of which
the practical financier would bring a considerable loss on the
public, the discovery of what this unexplained business is he thinks
rather improbable.- "unless the subject should be retaken up as far
back as the postulata in the second section of the first Essay: and
pursued from thence with an immensity of labors through paths
that [I have] he as (as he says) purposely passed by in silence" I think I have
discovered what he alludes to and in the paper No 2. you will
see [that] it detailed, [both] where it is demonstrated that a considerable loss,
must necessarily be sustained by the public if the particular is not attended
to, he has also I [can see] alluded to a particular mode, of making
the loans that shall be requisite, beyond the amount of the
revenue, to pay the periodical redemption money, for it is
evident to me, that if the loans are not properly conducted, the
public will be so much in the power of the money lenders that they
[may] rather may insist on a much larger premium than the former
ought to give. This you will see explained in Number 3d.

This [reason] [probable] reason which [in probability] deterred Mr Pitt from
adopting Mr Gales plan has rather to my knowledge been
given.- [One] has however latterly [answered] to me, and which
