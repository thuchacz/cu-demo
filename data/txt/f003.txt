These papers all so clearly evince the propriety
of borrowing on a high interest, when were it may
be necessary to borrow money, that I hope every
future loan to the United States will be made
on these principles. - and in order that no error
may be made in the compacts with the lenders
I have shown the terms which you will find
[h-N-n] - Ever yours affectly

Hon A. Hamilton Esqr

P.S. whether you shall remain in or resign the Superintendence
of the treasury department, it seems to me equally
proper that you should establish the principle on which
all future loans should be made, such as that the means
of redemption should invariable be annexed to the loans
[power] an accumulation of debt will always be
prevented without additional burthens on the people
and setting out on this system advantages will accrue
which no nation having a public debt has ever [had]
yet experienced. - the credit will be yours and
posterity will bless your memory for having
produced a system so replete with salutary
consequences - once more affectionately yours,

Ph. Schuyler
