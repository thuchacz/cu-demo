<lb/>appears to me of sufficient weight to justify that man is [?]
<lb/>for not entering in the business, precisely in the manner
<lb/>proposed by Mr Gale, which you will recollect was to estimate
<lb/>the value of the new stock on the depreciated value of the
<lb/>[the] three per cents sh[ow]ing the mean value of the latter at
<lb/>63 1/3, by which the public would share [nearly] or rather
<lb/>recover nearly what they had lost by the enormous
<lb/>premiums which have been given but such an estimate of the three per cents
<lb/>might be considered as taking an undue advantage of the
<lb/>creditors, who [ought] would expect [ought] to be paid the nominal capital which
<lb/>they received for the money they lent, be the latter more or
<lb/>less - Indeed if the conversion was made on the nominal
<lb/>capital, the debt in the new stock would be greater, and consequently
<lb/>the greater revenue must be [applied] provided for payments
<lb/>of the interest, but still the power of the [lending?] fund
<lb/>[would] [app????] [from] t the redemption. If [irredeemably?] applied
<lb/>would be such, as in about 25 years to superceed the necessity
<lb/>of any loans for the payment of the annual tender for
<lb/>the redemption. - and thence forward (the revenue which at
<lb/>the commencement of the conversion was sufficient for the
<lb/>[first] years interest) would be an accumulating [something] [pounds]
<lb/>which would always keep the debt within moderate bounds
<lb/>nay at any point which prudence and the weal of the
<lb/>nation should dictate, even altho wars and their
<lb/>attendant expenses should prevail as often as they
<lb/>have done in the present century -
