<lb/>These papers all so clearly evince the propriety
<lb/>of borrowing on a high interest, when were it may
<lb/>be necessary to borrow money, that I hope every
<lb/>future loan to the United States will be made
<lb/>on these principles. - and in order that no error
<lb/>may be made in the compacts with the lenders
<lb/>I have shown the terms which you will find
<lb/>[h-N-n] - Ever yours affectly

<lb/>P.S. whether you shall remain in or resign the Superintendence
<lb/>of the treasury department, it seems to me equally
<lb/>proper that you should establish the principle on which
<lb/>all future loans should be made, such as that the means
<lb/>of redemption should invariable be annexed to the loans
<lb/>[power] an accumulation of debt will always be
<lb/>prevented without additional burthens on the people
<lb/>and setting out on this system advantages will accrue
<lb/>which no nation having a public debt has ever [had]
<lb/>yet experienced. - the credit will be yours and
<lb/>posterity will bless your memory for having
<lb/>produced a system so replete with salutary
<lb/>consequences - once more affectionately yours,
