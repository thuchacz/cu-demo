<lb/>My Dear sir
</ab>
<ab>
<lb/>[agreeably to your request I should have eludicated]
<lb/>Mr Gales [algebraic demonstration] theorem relative to the value
<lb/>of annuity stocks, the worth of which he has demonstrated by an algebraic [process]
<lb/>process. I have confirmed by an [algeb] arithmetic computation
<lb/>and which you will have inclosed.

<ab>
<lb/>Mr Gale in his second Essay page 72 and in his third Essay
<lb/>page 60, posits that he has left [something] a particular unexplained relative

<lb/>back as the postulata in the second section of the first Essay: and
<lb/>pursued from thence with an immensity of labors through paths
<lb/>that [I have] he as (as he says) purposely passed by in silence" I think I have
<lb/>discovered what he alludes to and in the paper No 2. you will
<lb/>see [that] it detailed, [both] where it is demonstrated that a considerable loss,
<lb/>must necessarily be sustained by the public if the particular is not attended
<lb/>to, he has also I [can see] alluded to a particular mode, of making
<lb/>the loans that shall be requisite, beyond the amount of the
<lb/>revenue, to pay the periodical redemption money, for it is
<lb/>evident to me, that if the loans are not properly conducted, the
<lb/>public will be so much in the power of the money lenders that they
<lb/>[may] rather may insist on a much larger premium than the former
<lb/>ought to give. This you will see explained in Number 3d.

<ab>
<lb/>This [reason] [probable] reason which [in probability] deterred Mr Pitt from
<lb/>adopting Mr Gales plan has rather to my knowledge been
<lb/>given.- [One] has however latterly [answered] to me, and which
