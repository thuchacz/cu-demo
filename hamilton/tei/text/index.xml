<lb/>My Dear sir
</ab>
<ab>
<lb/>[agreeably to your request I should have eludicated]
<lb/>Mr Gales [algebraic demonstration] theorem relative to the value
<lb/>of annuity stocks, the worth of which he has demonstrated by an algebraic [process]
<lb/>process. I have confirmed by an [algeb] arithmetic computation
<lb/>and which you will have inclosed.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb/>Mr Gale in his second Essay page 72 and in his third Essay
<lb/>page 60, posits that he has left [something] a particular unexplained relative
<lb/>to the conversion of the debt, without [which] the knowledge of which
<lb/>the practical financier would bring a considerable loss on the
<lb/>public, the discovery of what this unexplained business is he thinks
<lb/>rather improbable.- "unless the subject should be retaken up as far
<lb/>back as the postulata in the second section of the first Essay: and
<lb/>pursued from thence with an immensity of labors through paths
<lb/>that [I have] he as (as he says) purposely passed by in silence" I think I have
<lb/>discovered what he alludes to and in the paper No 2. you will
<lb/>see [that] it detailed, [both] where it is demonstrated that a considerable loss,
<lb/>must necessarily be sustained by the public if the particular is not attended
<lb/>to, he has also I [can see] alluded to a particular mode, of making
<lb/>the loans that shall be requisite, beyond the amount of the
<lb/>revenue, to pay the periodical redemption money, for it is
<lb/>evident to me, that if the loans are not properly conducted, the
<lb/>public will be so much in the power of the money lenders that they
<lb/>[may] rather may insist on a much larger premium than the former
<lb/>ought to give. This you will see explained in Number 3d.
</ab>
<ab>
<lb/>This [reason] [probable] reason which [in probability] deterred Mr Pitt from
<lb/>adopting Mr Gales plan has rather to my knowledge been
<lb/>given.- [One] has however latterly [answered] to me, and which
</ab>

<pb facs="#f002"/>
<ab>
<lb/>appears to me of sufficient weight to justify that man is [?]
<lb/>for not entering in the business, precisely in the manner
<lb/>proposed by Mr Gale, which you will recollect was to estimate
<lb/>the value of the new stock on the depreciated value of the
<lb/>[the] three per cents sh[ow]ing the mean value of the latter at
<lb/>63 1/3, by which the public would share [nearly] or rather
<lb/>recover nearly what they had lost by the enormous
<lb/>premiums which have been given but such an estimate of the three per cents
<lb/>might be considered as taking an undue advantage of the
<lb/>creditors, who [ought] would expect [ought] to be paid the nominal capital which
<lb/>they received for the money they lent, be the latter more or
<lb/>less - Indeed if the conversion was made on the nominal
<lb/>capital, the debt in the new stock would be greater, and consequently
<lb/>the greater revenue must be [applied] provided for payments
<lb/>of the interest, but still the power of the [lending?] fund
<lb/>[would] [app????] [from] t the redemption. If [irredeemably?] applied
<lb/>would be such, as in about 25 years to superceed the necessity
<lb/>of any loans for the payment of the annual tender for
<lb/>the redemption. - and thence forward (the revenue which at
<lb/>the commencement of the conversion was sufficient for the
<lb/>[first] years interest) would be an accumulating [something] [pounds]
<lb/>which would always keep the debt within moderate bounds
<lb/>nay at any point which prudence and the weal of the
<lb/>nation should dictate, even altho wars and their
<lb/>attendant expenses should prevail as often as they
<lb/>have done in the present century -

<lb/>These papers all so clearly evince the propriety
<lb/>of borrowing on a high interest, when were it may
<lb/>be necessary to borrow money, that I hope every
<lb/>future loan to the United States will be made
<lb/>on these principles. - and in order that no error
<lb/>may be made in the compacts with the lenders
<lb/>I have shown the terms which you will find
<lb/>[h-N-n] - Ever yours affectly

<ab>
<lb/>P.S. whether you shall remain in or resign the Superintendence
<lb/>of the treasury department, it seems to me equally
<lb/>proper that you should establish the principle on which
<lb/>all future loans should be made, such as that the means
<lb/>of redemption should invariable be annexed to the loans
<lb/>[power] an accumulation of debt will always be
<lb/>prevented without additional burthens on the people
<lb/>and setting out on this system advantages will accrue
<lb/>which no nation having a public debt has ever [had]
<lb/>yet experienced. - the credit will be yours and
<lb/>posterity will bless your memory for having
<lb/>produced a system so replete with salutary
<lb/>consequences - once more affectionately yours,
